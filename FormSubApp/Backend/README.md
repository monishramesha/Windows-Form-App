# Backend Server for FormSubApp

This repository contains the backend server implementation for FormSubApp, a Windows desktop application for managing form submissions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the server, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version >= 14.x)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the backend server:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/monishramesha/FormSubApp.git
   cd FormSubApp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example`.
   - Update the `.env` file with necessary configurations (e.g., server port, database path).

4. **Start the Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the backend server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Server Endpoints

- **GET `/ping`**: Check server status. Returns `{ "success": true }`.
- **POST `/submit`**: Submit a new form entry with parameters `name`, `email`, `phone`, `github_link`, and `stopwatch_time`.
- **GET `/read`**: Retrieve a form submission at a specified index.

```

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that `db.json` exists and is accessible for the server to read and write submissions.
- Customize routes and handlers in `routes.ts` as per application requirements.
